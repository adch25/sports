            The defense throws the Frisbee disc (pulls) to the offense and the

            the disc.

        <ul className="guidlines">
          <li>
            On the first throw of the game or on a throw after any goal scored,
            a defense player cannot possess the Frisbee disc on first flight.
            Even if the Frisbee disc touches the ground, the offense gets the
            first possession.
          </li>
          <li> The Frisbee can be passed in any direction.</li>
          <li>
            {" "}
            If the Frisbee disc goes beyond the borders on the field, it is
            considered an outside and the possession switches. If a player drops
            the Frisbee disc, possession switches.
          </li>
          <li>
            A defense player has to maintain a minimum distance equivalent to an
            arm's length from the offense player in possession of the Frisbee
            disc. If the defense player fails to do so, it will be considered a
            foul.
          </li>
          <li>
            {" "}
            An offensive player is not allowed to run from the position where
            he/she caught the Frisbee disc and is still in possession of the
            Frisbee disc. If the offense player does so, it will be considered a
            foul.
          </li>
          <li>
            {" "}
            An Offense player has only 10 seconds to throw the disc. If the
            offense player fails to do so, possession will be exchanged.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a defense player taps the disc while it is in flight, the
            possession switches, and the defense becomes the offense and
            vice-versa.
          </li>
          <li>
            {" "}
            If a defense player taps the disc while it is in the hands of an
            offensive player, it is a defensive foul and he must restart his
            count from 1.
          </li>

            {" "}
            If a defense player during the defense doesn't clearly count 10
            seconds then the offense player can hold the frisbee even longer
            than 10 seconds without committing a foul.
          </li>
          <li>
            In case of any of the foul mentioned above, the possession switches
            immediately to the opposite team.
