          <li>Team composition: 5 (on field) + 1 (substitute) – 6 players.</li>
          <li>
            The team should comprise players from a minimum of 2 different
            batches. (eg: BTech ‘18, MTech ‘20, PhD ‘19)
          </li>

          <li>Faculty and Staff will be considered a different batch.</li>

          <li>
            Only one bounce inside your half is allowed every time the ball
            crosses the net.
          </li>
          <li>
            Maximum touches allowed = 3 (i.e., maximum 2 passes allowed between
            the players, and the 3rd hit should cross the net onto the opposite
            side).
          </li>
          <li>Every player has to play at least 1 set.</li>
          <li>
            Consecutive touches by a player are not allowed. Alternate touches
            are allowed.
          </li>
          <li>Players must play on the whistle.</li>
          <li>
            If any player touches the net at any point of time during a rally,
            their team loses the point.
          </li>
          <li>
            No player can cross any part of their body over the net onto the
            opposite side’s court while hitting the ball.
          </li>
          <li>Ball bouncing on the boundary lines is counted as IN.</li>
          <li>
            The ball can be served by tossing and kicking it without bouncing on
            the ground. Missing to hit the ball will result in losing the point
            and the serve.
          </li>
          <li>
            A player can serve at max 2 times as long as the service does not
            break.
          </li>
          <li>
            Service breaks if the team loses a point. The same player can't
            resume the service when they win their next point.
          </li>
          <li>
            After a player has served once, he or she can only serve again once
            all the teammates have served at least once.
          </li>
          <li>
            Girls may use their hands for service and playing. But if the team
            consists of more than one girl, then only one girl member can use
            her arm.
          </li>
          <li>Girls can use their hands behind the 2 meters line only.</li>
          <li>Using your hands in front of it is not allowed.</li>
          <li>Girls may use their arms but only under shoulder level.</li>
          <li>Overarm shots are not allowed.</li>
          <li>
            In-game substitutions are allowed at completion of half-set (8/15 or
            12/25) or full set only.
          </li>
          <li>Referee judgments are final.</li>
