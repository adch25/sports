            If the striker pockets the Queen and/or one or more coins, the

            A player may only pocket and cover the Queen if that player has
            already pocketed at least one his/her own C/m (coin), otherwise he
            has to pocket two his/her C/m to cover the queen.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a player pockets the Queen and his/her own C/m in the same turn,
            this counts and that player has covered the Queen.

            Queen and cover can be pocketed in the same striking, irrespective
            of the order of falling of coin in the pockets.

          <li>
            When a player pockets the Queen but does not cover it, the Queen is
            returned as near as possible to the centre circle by the opponent.

            While covering the Queen by a proper stroke, if a player pockets the
            striker along with his/her own C/m, the C/m shall be taken out for
            placing by the opponent. The player shall, however, continue his
            turn. If in that subsequent stroke no C/m of the player is pocketed,
            the Queen shall not be considered to have been covered and it shall
            be taken out for placing.
